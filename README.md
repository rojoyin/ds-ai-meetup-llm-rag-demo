## how to run this?

You can run this on a Jupyter notebook server. 

To be able to execute it, you must create a file called `.env` located at the root of the project. 
You can check the `.env.sample` file as starting point. You can check the documentation about how to create
a api key token for using openai programmatically [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart), just don't 
share this with anyone as anyone with this key could use the platform on your behalf. You don't have to worry about
commiting the `.env` file as it is ignored in the `.gitignore` file.
